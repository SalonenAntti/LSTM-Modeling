# Predicting stock performance with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## Overview

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict performance of various stocks, sector indices and market indices. The analysis uses stock prices for IBM, Apple, American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum. Sector Indices include Financial Sector Index, Technology Sector Index and Energy Sector Index. Market indices include GDP, SP500 and Unemployment Data. 

The project covers Data Collection and Preprocessing, Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA), Univariate-, Bivariate-, and Multivariate Time Series Analysis, Time Series Decomposition, Stationary and Autocorrelation Tests, Feature Engineering, and the training of LSTM models to forecast variable prices.

## Project Description

This repository contains an R project that predicts stock performance using LSTM models. The project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, covering steps from data collection and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and LSTM model training.

Goal of the project was to analyze stock market performance using time series analysis and build predictive models using LSTM modeling to forecast stock prices.
